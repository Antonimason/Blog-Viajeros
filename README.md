<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This has been my first project with the intention of learning how to develop a website with HTML and CSS. 
  
By making this page I learned the following: 

- Structuring HTML.
- Using its tags at a basic level.
- Operating different index.html.
- Using css selectors and properties.
- Use of media querys.
- Responsive Design.</p>

<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>The most challenging part of this project was the responsive design, as I had to deal with the adaptation of the header, images and order of the elements in the different devices.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

- Home: A section where you can receive an introduction to the site.

- Places: A resume of descriptions where this couple have travelled to.

- Blog: Where they offer certain alternatives for your next trip.

- About us: Where they talk a bit about the authors.
