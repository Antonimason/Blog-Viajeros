# Blog "Viajeros por el Mundo"


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This has been my first project with the intention of learning how to develop a website with html and css. By making this page I learned the following: structuring html, using its tags at a basic level, creating different index.html, using css selectors and properties, media querys.

One of the most challenging things for me in this project was to make the header, because through html and css I had to find a way to make it a responsive design.</p>
